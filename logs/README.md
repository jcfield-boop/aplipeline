# Logs Directory

This directory is for runtime logs generated by APL-CD operations.

## Log Types
- **Execution logs**: Pipeline run results and timing
- **Error logs**: Failure diagnostics and debugging info  
- **Performance logs**: Benchmarking and optimization data
- **Self-analysis logs**: Recursive testing results

## Usage
Logs are automatically generated during system operation:
- `./aplcicd test` - System test logs
- `./aplcicd pipeline` - CI/CD pipeline execution logs
- Demo scripts may generate performance and analysis logs

## Historical Logs
Previous system logs have been moved to `backup/logs_historical/`
