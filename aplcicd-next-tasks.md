    ⎕←'│     APL CI/CD Pipeline          │'
    ⎕←'├─────────────────────────────────┤'
    
    {
        symbol←(⍵⊃'✗' '✓' '⋯')[1+statuses[⍵]]
        ⎕←'│ ',symbol,' ',⍵⊃stages,'          │'

# After each change, run:
./aplcicd test-ci
./aplcicd status
./aplcicd demo
```

### Success Criteria:
- No `:Trap 0` error handlers remain
- All paths are configurable
- Demo runs without errors
- Vibe coding shows >90% compression

## 🎯 Remember the Goal

**Make judges say "Wow!"** by showing:
1. APL's superiority for AI-driven development
2. Real, working CI/CD (not simulation)
3. Measurable efficiency gains
4. The future of AI-native infrastructure

Good luck! The vibe coding concept is brilliant - let's make sure the implementation matches the vision!
