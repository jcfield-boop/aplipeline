# APL-CD: Array-Oriented Continuous Deployment

![APL](https://img.shields.io/badge/APL-Array%20Oriented-blue)
![Algorithm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithm-O(N²)-gold)

A continuous deployment system that uses APL's array operations for dependency resolution and pipeline execution.

## Overview

APL-CD implements CI/CD workflows using matrix-based algorithms instead of traditional graph traversal. The system processes dependencies through array operations, achieving O(N²) complexity for dependency resolution compared to typical O(N³) implementations.

### Key Features

- **Matrix-based dependency resolution**: Uses N×N boolean matrices instead of node/edge graphs
- **Array-oriented parallel execution**: Vectorized task scheduling and resource allocation  
- **Multi-language compilation**: Supports APL, JavaScript, Python, and C/C++ compilation
- **External tool integration**: Interfaces with Node.js, TypeScript, Babel, GCC, Clang
- **Enterprise features**: Security scanning, compliance checking, monitoring
- **Tatin package support**: Processes real APL packages from tatin.dev registry

## Architecture

### Core Components

**DependencyMatrix.dyalog**
- Builds N×N dependency matrices from project files
- Implements topological sorting for build order
- Detects circular dependencies using matrix operations
- Supports package.json, requirements.txt, and APL project parsing

**ParallelPipeline.dyalog**  
- Executes compilation, testing, and deployment tasks
- Uses array operations for parallel task scheduling
- Integrates with external build tools (tsc, babel, gcc, python)
- Manages resource allocation and monitoring

**EnterpriseIntegration.dyalog**
- Git repository integration and webhook configuration
- Jenkins and GitHub Actions workflow generation
- Kubernetes deployment manifests and scaling
- Security scanning and compliance validation

**Security.dyalog**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Resource limit enforcement
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Attack detection and mitigation

## Algorithm Details

### Dependency Resolution

```apl
⍝ Traditional approach: O(N³) nested loops
BuildOrder ← {
    nodes ← GetNodes ⍵
    :For node :In nodes
        :For dependency :In GetDependencies node
            :For transitive :In GetTransitiveDeps dependency
                ⍝ Process...
            :EndFor
        :EndFor  
    :EndFor
}

⍝ APL-CD approach: O(N²) matrix operations
BuildOrder ← {
    matrix ← BuildDependencyMatrix ⍵
    indegree ← +/matrix           ⍝ O(N²) operation
    order ← TopologicalSort matrix ⍝ O(N²) operation  
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Traditional | APL-CD |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Dependency resolution | O(N³) | O(N²) |
| Memory usage | O(N²) objects | O(N²) matrix |
| Parallel detection | O(N³) graph | O(N²) array |

## AI-Assisted Development

APL-CD can provide benefits in AI-assisted development environments where commit frequency may be higher.

### Development Patterns

**Traditional Development:**
- Typical teams: 5-15 commits/developer/week
- DevOps teams: 10-30 commits/developer/week

**AI-Assisted Development:**
- May involve higher commit frequency
- Rapid iteration cycles with AI suggestions
- More experimental commits during development

### Potential Benefits

Faster dependency resolution may provide:
- Reduced build times for frequent commits
- Less waiting during development cycles
- Improved developer experience with shorter feedback loops

Actual benefits will depend on project size, complexity, and development workflow.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Dyalog APL 19.0 or later
- Unix-like system (macOS, Linux, WSL)
- Git for repository operations

### Optional External Tools

- Node.js (for JavaScript/TypeScript compilation)
- Python (for Python compilation and validation)  
- GCC/Clang (for C/C++ compilation)
- TypeScript, Babel, Webpack (for enhanced JS processing)

### Setup

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd aplipeline
./aplcicd test    # Run system validation
```

## Usage

### Basic Operations

```bash
# Run complete system demonstration
./aplcicd complete

# Test dependency resolution
./aplcicd demo

# Comprehensive system testing  
./aplcicd test

# Monitor system performance
./aplcicd monitor
```

### APL Interface

```apl
⍝ Load system
⎕FIX'file://src/APLCICD.dyalog'
APLCICD.Initialize

⍝ Analyze project dependencies
deps ← DependencyMatrix.ParseAPLProject 'src'

⍝ Execute CI/CD pipeline
result ← ParallelPipeline.ExecuteCompilation files config
```

## Configuration

System configuration is managed through `config/default.json`:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "timeout": 300000,
    "parallel_workers": 4,
    "memory_limit": 536870912
  },
  "security": {
    "max_file_size": 10485760,
    "allowed_extensions": [".dyalog", ".apl", ".aplf", ".aplc"],
    "rate_limit": 100
  }
}
```

## Testing

### Validation Tests

The system includes comprehensive test suites:

- **Dependency parsing**: Tests with real package.json and requirements.txt files
- **External repositories**: Validation against aplteam-Tester2 from GitHub
- **Security**: Attack simulation and input validation testing
- **Performance**: Benchmarking against traditional CI/CD approaches
- **Integration**: End-to-end pipeline execution
