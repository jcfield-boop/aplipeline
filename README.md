# APL-CD: Array-Oriented Continuous Deployment

![APL](https://img.shields.io/badge/APL-Array%20Oriented-blue)
![Algorithm](https://img.shields.io/badge/Algorithm-O(N¬≤)-gold)

A continuous deployment system that uses APL's array operations for dependency resolution and pipeline execution.

## Overview

APL-CD implements CI/CD workflows using matrix-based algorithms instead of traditional graph traversal. The system processes dependencies through array operations, achieving O(N¬≤) complexity for dependency resolution compared to typical O(N¬≥) implementations.

### Key Features

- **Matrix-based dependency resolution**: Uses N√óN boolean matrices instead of node/edge graphs
- **Array-oriented parallel execution**: Vectorized task scheduling and resource allocation  
- **Multi-language compilation**: Supports APL, JavaScript, Python, and C/C++ compilation
- **External tool integration**: Interfaces with Node.js, TypeScript, Babel, GCC, Clang
- **Enterprise features**: Security scanning, compliance checking, monitoring
- **Tatin package support**: Processes real APL packages from tatin.dev registry

## Architecture

## Algorithm Details

### Dependency Resolution

```apl
‚çù Traditional approach: O(N¬≥) nested loops
BuildOrder ‚Üê {
    nodes ‚Üê GetNodes ‚çµ
    :For node :In nodes
        :For dependency :In GetDependencies node
            :For transitive :In GetTransitiveDeps dependency
                ‚çù Process...
            :EndFor
        :EndFor  
    :EndFor
}

‚çù APL-CD approach: O(N¬≤) matrix operations
BuildOrder ‚Üê {
    matrix ‚Üê BuildDependencyMatrix ‚çµ
    indegree ‚Üê +/matrix           ‚çù O(N¬≤) operation
    order ‚Üê TopologicalSort matrix ‚çù O(N¬≤) operation  
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

| Operation | Traditional | APL-CD |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Dependency resolution | O(N¬≥) | O(N¬≤) |
| Memory usage | O(N¬≤) objects | O(N¬≤) matrix |
| Parallel detection | O(N¬≥) graph | O(N¬≤) array |

## AI-Assisted Development

APL-CD can provide benefits in AI-assisted development environments where commit frequency may be higher.

### Development Patterns

**Traditional Development:**
- Typical teams: 5-15 commits/developer/week
- DevOps teams: 10-30 commits/developer/week

**AI-Assisted Development:**
- May involve higher commit frequency
- Rapid iteration cycles with AI suggestions
- More experimental commits during development

### Potential Benefits

Faster dependency resolution may provide:
- Reduced build times for frequent commits
- Less waiting during development cycles
- Improved developer experience with shorter feedback loops

Actual benefits will depend on project size, complexity, and development workflow.

## Installation
