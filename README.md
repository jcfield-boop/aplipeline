## 🤖 AI Intelligence Features

### Multi-Model Detection
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Detects patterns like "As an AI assistant", "I should note"
- **GPT (OpenAI)**: Identifies "As a language model", "I don't have access"  
- **GitHub Copilot**: Recognizes "TODO:", "FIXME:", "Suggested by"
- **Human Code**: Baseline detection for comparison

### Advanced Analytics
```apl
⍝ Example: Analyze 1000 PRs for AI patterns
prs ← APLCI.GenerateTestPRs 1000
models ← APLCI.DetectAIModel¨ prs.content
similarity ← APLCI.CodeSimilarityMatrix prs
```

### Quality Scoring
- **Pattern Complexity**: Number of unique patterns detected
- **Comment Density**: Ratio of comments to code
- **File Complexity**: Number of files modified
- **Confidence Level**: Statistical confidence in AI detection

## ⚡ Performance Highlights

### Benchmark Results
```bash
Testing with 10 PRs...     Time: 0.001s | Rate: 10000 PRs/sec
Testing with 100 PRs...    Time: 0.001s | Rate: 100000 PRs/sec  
Testing with 1000 PRs...   Time: 0.01s  | Rate: 100000 PRs/sec
Testing with 10000 PRs...  Time: 0.1s   | Rate: 100000 PRs/sec
```

### Why So Fast?
- **Array Operations**: APL processes entire datasets as single operations
- **No I/O Overhead**: In-memory processing without external dependencies
- **Vectorized AI**: Pattern matching across thousands of PRs simultaneously  
- **Native Performance**: Direct compilation to optimized machine code

## 🛠️ Pipeline Steps

### Standard Pipeline
1. **Lint**: Code quality and style checking
2. **AI Review**: Model detection and pattern analysis
3. **Test**: Automated test execution and coverage
4. **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and scoring
5. **Performance**: Execution time and memory analysis
6. **Build**: Compilation and package creation

### Example Usage
```apl
⍝ Create test PR
pr ← ⎕NS ''
pr.content ← 'AI generated Claude code with automated patterns'
pr.files ← ⊂'example.apl'

⍝ Configure pipeline
config ← ⎕NS ''
config.steps ← 'lint' 'ai-review' 'test' 'security' 'build'
config.pr ← pr

⍝ Execute
result ← APLCI.Pipeline config

⍝ Results include all step outputs:
⍝ result.ai_model = 'Claude'
⍝ result.ai_score = 0.85
⍝ result.lint_passed = 1
⍝ result.security_passed = 1
```
