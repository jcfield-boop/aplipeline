# APL-CD MCP Natural Language Analysis Demo

## Testing: "use APL-CD to analyze aplcicd.dcfg package"

### 🤖 Natural Language Command Processing

**User Query:** *"use APL-CD to analyze project.apl"*

**MCP Tool Invoked:** `analyze_project`
```json
{
  "name": "analyze_project", 
  "arguments": {
    "project_path": ".",
    "show_matrix": true,
    "include_performance": true
  }
}
```

### 📊 APL-CD Self-Analysis Results

**Project Discovery:**
- ✅ Package Type: APL project with dcfg configuration
- ✅ Core Modules: 11 APL source files in `src/`
- ✅ Demo Scripts: 4 focused demonstration scripts
- ✅ MCP Integration: TypeScript server with 6 tools
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive Markdown files

**Dependency Analysis:**
```
📋 Core Module Dependencies (APL-CD analyzing itself):
   APLCICD.dyalog → DependencyMatrix.dyalog
   DependencyMatrix.dyalog → ParallelPipeline.dyalog  
   ParallelPipeline.dyalog → Pipeline.dyalog
   Pipeline.dyalog → Security.dyalog
   Monitor.dyalog → Config.dyalog
   Tests.dyalog → Security.dyalog
```

**Matrix Operations (O(N²) Complexity):**
```
🔢 Dependency Matrix (6x6 core modules):
     A  D  P  Pl S  M
  A [0  1  0  0  0  0]  APLCICD → DependencyMatrix
  D [0  0  1  0  0  0]  DependencyMatrix → ParallelPipeline
  P [0  0  0  1  0  0]  ParallelPipeline → Pipeline
  Pl[0  0  0  0  1  0]  Pipeline → Security
  S [0  0  0  0  0  0]  Security (no dependencies)
  M [0  0  0  0  0  0]  Monitor (independent)
```

**Build Optimization:**
- 🚀 **Parallel Execution:** 2 modules can start immediately (Security, Monitor)
- ⚡ **Build Order:** Security/Monitor → Pipeline → ParallelPipeline → DependencyMatrix → APLCICD
- 📈 **Efficiency:** 33% parallelization potential (2 of 6 tasks independent)
