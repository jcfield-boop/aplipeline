# APL-CD Claude Desktop Integration

## Overview

APL-CD now features seamless integration with Claude Desktop via MCP (Model Context Protocol), making array-oriented CI/CD operations accessible through natural language conversation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install for Claude Desktop
./setup-claude-desktop.sh

# Restart Claude Desktop
# Ready to use!
```

## Available Commands
